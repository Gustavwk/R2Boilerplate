# PlsNoSlug

PlsNoSlug is a mod for Risk of Rain 2 that enhances gameplay by modifying item drop logic and stage interactions. It adds unique item selection mechanics and balances chest spawn rates for a more customized experience.

## Features

- **Custom Item Pools**: Each stage dynamically selects random items for every item tier.
- **Chest Spawn Balancing**: Chest spawn chances are increased for better loot opportunities.
- **Dynamic Item Overrides**: Overrides item drops to provide stage-specific items.
- **Simplified Gameplay Interaction**: pray for no slugs and only impactful items!

## How It Works

- **Item Pooling**: The mod assigns specific items to each tier (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Boss, Void) at the start of every stage.
- **Chest Tweaks**: Chests have increased spawn rates, making exploration more rewarding.
- **Custom Drops**: Only publicly available and unlocked items are included in the pool.
